Repository: https://github.com/AdmiralCrunchy/Code_Cleanup_VT

## Notes:

---

Things are a little messed up as I originally started messing with the files that were in the main repository first before I realized that we had to make a seperate Repo for this assignment. So my apologies for that.

Going forward I will make sure to make the Repository first.

---

## Changes that were Made Before REPO

---

* Placed the most used font style in the global position and got rid of them where they were repeated.

* Got rid of a ton of unneeded DIV tags.

* Replaced DIV's with Main and Section Tags.

* Footer class was removed and replaced with the tag in the html file.

* Truncated down the classes that were associated with Search Engine, Online Rep & Social media into the 'topPortion' id. Did the same for other images associated with similar tags and images to 'content' & 'benefits'

* Header class removed.

* hyperlink to 'Search-enginge-optimization' led nowhere, fixed that.

## Confidence in Assignment:

---

Fairly good, this is the first time in a long time that I have turned in an assignment as well as sat down and lood at syntax. I feel I did a adiquite job of truncating down a lot of the code in the files, but time will tell. I feel like I need to get better about my commenting within the files and also be better at writing up a change log. Overall this was a good jumping in assignment and I am very excited for what comes next.
